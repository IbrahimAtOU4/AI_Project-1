Answer questions marked as "QS"

QS1.1:
- For DFS, you implement it using a stack. This is because we want to follow the LIFO style,
which explores nodes that are most recently added. this means that when you go down one level,
then add a node, you will explore that node, then the one below it. first however, you expand the 
both of the nodes children.
